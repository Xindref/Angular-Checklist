## Additional Information

Double click to set reminder status, this doesn't do anything at the moment other than toggle a bool in the service adding a green line to the side of the task. Delete a Task with the ‚ùå, and add a Task by clicking Add Task and Save Task. Error checker checks for an empty string for Task Name. This project was a tutorial followed by Traversy Media on YouTube from May 6, 2021 using the old Angular module system. I updated it's use to standalone components with imports. This is my first Angular project, and it has been a journey learning how these components work together, wouldn't necessarily recommend this is a starting project for Angular but it was a good peek into the things you can do with it.
